git init = initialize a git repository folder locally
git config --global user.email <email>
git config --global user.name <name>
git config --global core.editor <editor-choice>
git branch -m <new name> = changes the current branch name
git remote add origin <repo url> = adds a remote repository and hooks it up to the url
(actually "origin" is a naming convention for remote repos, can be any name)

NOTE: when prompt to enter password, use personal access token (generate it from developer settings in github)

git push -u origin main = pushes committed changes onto remote repo called "origin" to "main" branch
(-u sets upstream, future git pull and push will track and update only that branch)

git remote -v =view current set up push and pull
git remote set-url <remote-name(in this case: origin)> <new-url> =changes the push and pull location

OR

Generate an SSH key and link it to your github account
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "work@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work OR just ssh-keygen
-t = type, rsa
-b = no. of bits, 4096
-c = comments, optional "work@example.com"
-f = specify filename for the generated key, ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work  (it will be stored in id_rsa_work)
