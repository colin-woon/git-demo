git init = initialize a git repository folder locally
git config --global user.email <email>
git config --global user.name <name>
git config --global core.editor <editor-choice>
git branch -m <new name> = changes the current branch name
git remote add origin <repo url> = adds a remote repository and hooks it up to the url
(actually "origin" is a naming convention for remote repos, can be any name)

NOTE: when prompt to enter password, use personal access token (generate it from developer settings in github)

git push -u origin main = pushes committed changes onto remote repo called "origin" to "main" branch
(-u sets upstream, future git pull and push will track and update only that branch)

git remote -v =view current set up push and pull
git remote set-url origin =changes the push and pull location
